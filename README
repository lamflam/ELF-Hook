Bugfixes of this fork:
--------------------------

1. If the dso doesn't have the .got.plt section, there was a crash because of no write permission to a memory page (according to valgrind).
I faced this issue with libmysqlclient on ubuntu precise. The main reason for this is unknown.

2. If the dso doesn't have the .got section, there was a crash. I faced this with the library that was compiled with "-nostartfiles -fPIC" on x86 32bit.
The reason for this is unknown either.
